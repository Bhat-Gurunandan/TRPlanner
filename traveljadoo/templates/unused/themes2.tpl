					<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of 
					classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin 
					professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, 
					consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the citeis of the word in classical 
					literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 
					of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.</p>
