				<h1>Hans Tuinman</h1>
				<p><img src="images/HANS02.jpg" width="240" height="150" alt="Hans Tuinman" /> Born in the Netherlands in 1956, Hans 
				Tuinman studied History &amp; Anthropology at the Free University 
				of Amsterdam. His studies culminated into a thesis on the "Untouchables of India" from the University of New 
				South Wales in Sydney. Married to an Indian wife, Sucheta, they started together organising tours to India 
				in the early eighties which culminated in a full fledged adventure travel company, Odyssey Tours &amp; Travels Pvt Ltd. 
				Now settled in Goa, they also look after their luxury yacht "<a href="solita.in">Solita</a>" which operates cruises 
				in and around Goan waters.</p>
				<hr />
				<h1>Sucheta Potnis</h1>
				<p><img src="images/SUCHETA01.jpg" width="240" height="150" alt="Sucheta Potnis" /> Sucheta Potnis was born in Mumbai 
				in 1958. She studied Psychology and did her post-graduation in Public Relations 
				and Marketing. Sucheta was the first Indian woman to lead a group of foreign tourists on a camel safari through the 
				Thar Desert of Rajasthan in the early 1980s. Her interests range from wildlife, nature and the many handicrafts of 
				India. Apart from looking after the marketing of Odyssey Tours &amp; Travels Pvt Ltd, Sucheta is also a freelance 
				writer and has contributed to many magazines and guidebooks, Indian and international.</p>
				<hr />
				<h1>Phil Rolph</h1>
				<p><img src="images/PHIL01.jpg" width="240" height="150" alt="Phil Rolph" /> Born in England in 1961, Phil Rolph 
				is the most widely travelled person in the company. He escorted adventure 
				tours in North Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and the Far East and in between he took holidays in other parts 
				of the world. Now settled in Goa, Phil is the Operations Manager of the company. His in-depth knowledge of the South 
				Asia sub-continent assists the company in creating itineraries for the more discerning travellers.</p>
				<hr />
				<h1>Felix Furtado</h1>
				<p><img src="images/FELIX02.jpg" width="240" height="150" alt="Felix Furtado" /> In his ten years with us, Felix has grown 
				to be an extremely confident person. He was a tour leader for many years 
				before joining our office team full time. His sense of humour and his incredible contacts that can get you anything 
				under the sun, make him truly indispensable. Although Felix has traveled extensively, his own specialty is South India. 
				From Kanyakumari to Leh, he knows not just the destination, but also the names of the hotel staff! Felix handles our 
				database, a daunting task considering its enormous size.</p>
				<hr />
				<h1>Gwen Figuieredo</h1>
				<p><img src="images/GWEN02.jpg" width="240" height="150" alt="Gwen Figuieredo" /> Since she had been working with the 
				prestigious Taj Holiday Village and later, the swanky Marriott Goa, we were unsure 
				how Gwen would fit into our decidedly unusual office in a jungle with so many Alpha males around. We needn't have worried! 
				Gwen fits in beautifully.  Gwen will never forget anyone's birthday; neither will she forget a minute detail of a booking 
				she is handling. Combined with this, her extensive travel experience, Gwen truly is the backbone of our FIT operations. </p>
				<hr />
				<h1>Krishna Madgaonkar</h1>
				<p><img src="images/KRISHNA01.jpg" width="240" height="150" alt="Krishna Madgaonkar" /> 
				After working late shifts in a travel company, Krishna is delighted to join us and work more normal hours. He is quietly 
				dogged and very observant, qualities that make him ideal for dealing with complicated FIT requests.</p>
				<hr />
				<h1>Nora Fernandes</h1>
				<p><img src="images/NORA02.jpg" width="240" height="150" alt="Nora Fernandes" /> Also another ex-member of the Taj, 
				Nora is the perfect tomboy. Her sheer energy, quick grasp and direct approach make 
				her a fantastic team person. On the road, she is like a terrier, visiting so many people and packing so much in the day, 
				that we suspect she travels with her clone!</p>
				<hr />
				<h1>Ivan Menezes</h1>
				<p><img src="images/IVAN01.jpg" width="240" height="150" alt="Ivan Menezes" /> Whenever a computer/printer/modem is down, 
				we all holler for Ivan, who happily puts right whatever was wrong. In between 
				all this, he single-handedly looks after our vast railway reservations - not a job for the faint hearted! Nothing is too 
				much for Ivan - his smile remains in place no matter what is happening!</p>
				<hr />
				<h1>Shalome Potnis</h1>
				<p><img src="images/SHALU01.jpg" width="240" height="150" alt="Shalome Potnis" /> After finishing her graduation in English 
				Literature from Bombay University, Shalome worked for a year leading tour groups 
				throughout India. After that she studied International Trade between Spain and Asian countries in Barcelona. Now she has joined 
				us as a Product Manager for which she travels very extensively checking out new destinations and hotels. She also re-visits them 
				to ensure that quality is kept up-to our standards. Much of the content of the website is written by her. Her travels ensures 
				that the knowledge in our offices remains fresh and updated at all times.</p>
				<hr />
				<h1>Hemlata Jadhav</h1>
				<p><img src="images/HEMLATA01.jpg" width="240" height="150" alt="Hemlata Jadhav" />A Bombayite by birth, Hemlata married a Goan 
				guy and the two of them worked for a few years in the Middle East where she worked 
				for an airline's reservation system. Now back in Goa, the couple has a lovely 3 year old daughter.  Hemlata is one of the last ones 
				to join our team but already she has made her mark. Her inside knowledge of airline ticketing enabled her to grasp our state of art 
				back-office system in no time. Today, she is an invaluable member to our Reservations team.</p>
				<h1>Sylvia D'Souza</h1>
				<p><img src="images/SYLVIA01.jpg" width="240" height="150" alt="Sylvia D'Souza" /> Petite Sylvia rules with a hard hand clothed in a velvet glove. She is extremely polite till the time she suspects someone 
				is trying to do her out of a single penny then people run for cover. Her voice will drop cool anger, making the person squirm. 
				She is the darling of all the hoteliers and agents - they know that she is extremely prompt in her payments. This has made 
				Odyssey a perennial favourite of all our suppliers.</p>
				<hr />
				<h1>Anthony Pontis</h1>
				<p><img src="images/ANTHONY01.jpg" width="240" height="150" alt="Anthony Pontis" /> Anthony's capability is in his thoroughness and his eye for detail. He is fantastic for keeping all the accounts in line and 
				being a very able second in command to Sylvia.</p>
