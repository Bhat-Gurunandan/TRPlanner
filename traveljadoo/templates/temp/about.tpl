				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Jadoo is Persian for 'magic'. This magic is reflected in our web site which offers 
				the most innovative and interactive way to let you put together a customised tour online.</p>
				<p>Travel Jadoo has been developed by Odyssey Tours & Travels Pvt Ltd based in Goa.</p>
				<p>Our company has been operating inbound tours to India since the mid-1980s. We are a Government Approved agency and member of the 
				Indian Association of Tour Operators (I.A.T.O.), the Travel Agents Association of India (T.A.A.I.), and the Pacific Asia Tourism Association 
				(P.A.T.A.).</p>
				<p>Over the last two decades, we have traveled the length and breadth of the sub-continent to find exciting and unusual places to stay in 
				some of India's most beautiful and fascinating locations. Our website reflects the growing collection of our favourite small hotels, guesthouses, 
				retreats, eco-lodges, heritage hotels and unforgettable travel experiences, all of them personally visited by us and honestly reviewed in detail, 
				with photos to match.</p>
				<p>The most interesting aspect of our website is a unique Smart Route Finder which helps you to easily put together a feasible custom tour online. 
				In "Plan a Trip", you simply select the places to stay and click for your preferred choice of transport, and our Travel Wizard does the rest by 
				putting together a tailor-made tour along with an instant quotation! You are then able to amend the proposed itinerary to arrive at a program of 
				your choice.</p>
				<p>Happy browsing and we hope you enjoy your tour!</p>
