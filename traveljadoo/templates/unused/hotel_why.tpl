				<h1>Special Places</h1>
				<p>
					In India, there is a mind-boggling range of hotels; from deluxe international standard hotels to smaller,
					simpler places. The charm of travelling in India is this enormous variety of hotels.
        			According to us, a hotel room is much more than just a place where you spend the night &#8212; it can, and should 
					be a memorable part of your holiday. Our choice is not restricted to a single price category &#8212; but we do demand 
					for something special which makes the hotel unique. Be it the location, the history of the building, the ambience, 
					certainly the personalized service, and often all those combined, are what we seek.
        		</p>
         		<p>
         			This website is therefore not an all inclusive listing of hotels in India. It is a definite website restricted to 
					special places we have selected. The budget of these can vary from what we term Moderate (up to 50 Euro per night) 
					to Superior (between 50 to 100 Euro per night) and finally Luxury (more than 100 Euro per night). The reason why a 
					particular hotel is included in Travel Jadoo&#8216;s &#8221;Special Places&#8220;, is that no matter what the price tag, the hotel will 
					offer a genuinely hospitable atmosphere and a certain sense of style.
         		</p>
        		<p>
        			The reviews and descriptions are all original and based on our own team&#8216;s experiences. No hotel pays us to be included 
					on this website thereby keeping our views objective.
        		</p>
				<p>
					Happy browsing through our Special Places &#8212; and we hope you enjoy the tour!
